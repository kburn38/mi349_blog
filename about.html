    <p>I do not have much to say, but here is something</p>
    <p><img alt="hello it me" src="Pictures/me.jpg"></p>
    <p>Hello, my name is Kyle Burnham and I am the creator and author of this blog. I am not typically a blog writer but I can talk for a while about things I am passionate about. Video games have been a part of my life for a long time and even though I was not born in the late 70s or 80s, I still love to learn and talk about how video games developed then and have evolved since then. The current console I own include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Nintendo Famicom</li>
        <li>Nintendo Entertainment System</li>
        <li>Nintendo Super Famicom</li>
        <li>Super Nintendo Entertainment System</li>
        <li>JVC X'Eye</li>
        <li>Nintendo Gamecube</li>
        <li>Game Boy Advance SP</li>
        <li>Nintendo DSi</li>
        <li>Playstation 3</li>
        <li>Nintendo 3DS</li>
        <li>Playstation Vita</li>
        <li>Playstation 4</li>
        <li>Nintendo Wii U</li>
    </ul>
    <p>On top of a large number of games for these systems. I plan to expand my collection for as long as I live and I enjoy the weird and wacky consoles</p>
